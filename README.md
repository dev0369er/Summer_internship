ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Company: KrishaWeb

Role: Project Analyst Intern

Duration: 4 Weeks

Objective: To bridge the gap between data analytics and strategic business insights by working on real-world datasets, developing dashboards, and applying machine learning for decision-making.

ðŸ“… Week 1 â€“ Data Handling & Cleaning

1) Imported raw data (CSV/Excel) into Python and Power BI.
2) Cleaned datasets using Excel and Pandas (missing value imputation, duplicates removal, formatting).
3) Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
4) Built an interactive Power BI prototype dashboard for sales data.
5) Practiced SQL queries (Joins, Group By, Aggregates) for business reporting.

 Tech Stack: Excel, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI, MySQL

ðŸ“… Week 2 â€“ Life Expectancy Analysis

1) Used Life Expectancy dataset to explore correlations between socio-economic and health indicators.
2) Performed EDA (distribution plots, heatmaps, outlier detection).
3) Conducted correlation analysis (impact of GDP, schooling, health expenditure).
4) Designed a dashboard for visualization of life expectancy trends.

 Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Plotly, Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“… Week 3 â€“ Sentiment & Emotion Analysis

1) Analyzed Twitter dataset for sentiment/emotion recognition using TensorFlow & NLP techniques.
2) Classified emotions like joy, anger, sadness, fear, and neutral.
3) Conducted A/B testing simulation to evaluate sentiment-driven marketing campaigns.
4) Applied PCA & Chi-square tests to uncover deeper relationships in customer behavior.
5) Generated Plotly dashboards for interactive emotion insights.

 Tech Stack: Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NLTK), Plotly, Pandas

ðŸ“… Week 4 â€“ Business Insights & CLTV

1) Developed Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) models to predict long-term profitability.
2) Integrated churn prediction, segmentation, and sentiment scores into a Power BI business dashboard.
3) Built interactive KPIs for Response Rate, CLTV, and Total Spend.
4) Applied scenario-based forecasting (+10% marketing spend) using Prophet/ARIMA.
5) Consolidated all work into a final capstone report & dashboard.

 Tech Stack: Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet, Plotly), Power BI

Conclusion
