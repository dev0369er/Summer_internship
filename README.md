ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Company: KrishaWeb

Role: Project Analyst Intern

Duration: 4 Weeks

Objective: To bridge the gap between data analytics and strategic business insights by working on real-world datasets, developing dashboards, and applying machine learning for decision-making.

ðŸ“… Week 1 â€“ Data Handling & Cleaning

##Imported raw data (CSV/Excel) into Python and Power BI.
##Cleaned datasets using Excel and Pandas (missing value imputation, duplicates removal, formatting).
âœ” Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
âœ” Built an interactive Power BI prototype dashboard for sales data.
âœ” Practiced SQL queries (Joins, Group By, Aggregates) for business reporting.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Excel, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI, MySQL

ðŸ“… Week 2 â€“ Life Expectancy Analysis

âœ” Used Life Expectancy dataset to explore correlations between socio-economic and health indicators.
âœ” Performed EDA (distribution plots, heatmaps, outlier detection).
âœ” Conducted correlation analysis (impact of GDP, schooling, health expenditure).
âœ” Designed a dashboard for visualization of life expectancy trends.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Plotly, Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ“… Week 3 â€“ Sentiment & Emotion Analysis

âœ” Analyzed Twitter dataset for sentiment/emotion recognition using TensorFlow & NLP techniques.
âœ” Classified emotions like joy, anger, sadness, fear, and neutral.
âœ” Conducted A/B testing simulation to evaluate sentiment-driven marketing campaigns.
âœ” Applied PCA & Chi-square tests to uncover deeper relationships in customer behavior.
âœ” Generated Plotly dashboards for interactive emotion insights.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NLTK), Plotly, Pandas

ðŸ“… Week 4 â€“ Business Insights & CLTV

âœ” Developed Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) models to predict long-term profitability.
âœ” Integrated churn prediction, segmentation, and sentiment scores into a Power BI business dashboard.
âœ” Built interactive KPIs for Response Rate, CLTV, and Total Spend.
âœ” Applied scenario-based forecasting (+10% marketing spend) using Prophet/ARIMA.
âœ” Consolidated all work into a final capstone report & dashboard.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack: Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet, Plotly), Power BI

âœ… Conclusion

My internship at KrishaWeb strengthened my skills in data analytics, business intelligence, and applied machine learning.
I gained hands-on experience in:

Cleaning and preprocessing real-world datasets.

Performing EDA and advanced statistical analysis.

Building predictive models for customer behavior.

Designing interactive dashboards for business stakeholders.

This internship helped me connect technical analytics with practical business decision-making.
